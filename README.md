## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the property background-position before this project I had no idea of how to use this.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-position: right 50vw bottom 50vh, 50vw 50vh;
}
```
### Continued development

- Responsive Design
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - I think this is a great resource for learn how to use whatever property you need to use.
